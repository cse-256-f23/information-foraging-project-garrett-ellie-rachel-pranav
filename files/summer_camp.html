        <p>
          Designed for children ages two and a half to five years, our summer
          camp program includes a wide range of creative indoor and outdoor
          activities, with time to explore and discover, play and make
          friends. Since a good number of hours are spent outside during
          summer camp, the nursery school playground provides opportunities to
          cool off with outdoor water play that includes troughs, sprinklers
          and hoses. Building in the sand and playing on the climbing
          equipment are two other favorite outdoor activities. An adjoining
          wading pool is available for summer campers, whether enrolled in the
          swimming classes or not. Children bring their own lunches. Camp
          provides a morning snack.
