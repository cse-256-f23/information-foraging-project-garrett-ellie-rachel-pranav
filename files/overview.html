        <h1>Curriculum Overview</h1>
    <p>
        
        At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that children are unique individuals with
            their own patterns and timetables for social, emotional, intellectual, and physical development.
            We support and encourage their development through our child-centered, process-oriented, play-
            based curriculum built on Constructivist theories and practices. Guided by the teachings of
            educational theorists including Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, DeVries, and others, we create a
            learning environment that addresses the developmental needs of the whole child by:
        <ul>
            
           <li> Structuring classroom experiences around ideas and topics that are relevant to the
            students, with the understanding that knowledge is constructed through language,
            discussion, experimentation, and manipulation of objects that are meaningful to them</li>
            <li>Offering hands-on learning experiences that use a variety of materials, engage multiple
            senses, and encourage exploration, investigation, and learning</li>
            <li> Allowing each child to interact with the environment at his/her own pace, and creating
            opportunities for children to explore individually, with a partner, or with a larger group
            of peers</li>
            <li>Asking open-ended questions, allowing students the time to thoughtfully form responses,
            listening respectfully to their replies, and gently guiding them toward the answers they
            seek as they develop enhanced reasoning skills</li>
            <li>Respecting students’ ideas, encouraging independent thinking, and empowering students
            to become problem solvers</li>
           <li> Using the wonderful resource of our diverse, multi-cultural population to highlight the
            similarities and differences between individuals, families, and cultures, celebrating the
            unique environment that is Washington University Nursery School.</li>
            The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on
            an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to
            meet students’ needs.
            If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety
            of ways, which may include: 
           <li> Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking
            process, build trust, and increase student confidence</li>
            <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
            <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
            <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
            <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
            order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process</li>
            <li>Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
            concept, skill, or area of concern</li>
            
        </ul>
        Washington University Nursery School’s open curriculum framework is presented in ways that
            are developmentally appropriate and based on our philosophy that children learn most effectively
            through play. Using a learning center approach, each teaching team offers experiences in art,
            writing, science, dramatic play, blocks, manipulatives, and literacy. Teacher planning takes into
            account the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical developmental needs of each child.
