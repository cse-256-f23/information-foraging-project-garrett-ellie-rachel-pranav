        <h1>Staff</h1>
    <p>
        The	staff	at	the	nursery	school	respects	and	appreciates	the	talents	and	personalities	of	each	
        child	and	his	or	her	family.	A	teacherâ€™s	individual	talents	are	also	encouraged	as	she	or	he	
        develops	his	or	her	own	personal	approach	in	the	classroom.	This	makes	for	a	vibrant,	
        growing	community	of	children,	families	and	teachers.
        In	general,	teachers	hold	a	Bachelor	or	Master	degree	in	early	childhood or	elementary
        education	and/or	teaching.		All	have	extensive	early	childhood	teaching	experience.
        <a href="https://nurseryschool.wustl.edu/about/staff/">(https://nurseryschool.wustl.edu/about/staff/)</a>
        Professional	development	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.		The	school	pays	fees	for	
        workshops	and	conferences	during	the	year.		In	addition,	there	are	two teacher	in-service	
        days	and	monthly	staff	meetings.		All	teachers	are	certified	in CPR	and	First	Aid.
