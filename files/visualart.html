        <h2>Visual Arts</h2>

        <p>At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as important building blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those manipulations. We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently or as part of a group, can help increase a childâ€™s attention span, improve fine motor skills, strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk</li>
