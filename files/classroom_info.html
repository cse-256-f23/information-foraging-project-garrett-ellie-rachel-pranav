        <h1>Classroom Information</h1>
    <p>
        Our	classes focus	on	social	development	and	learning	through	play.	Each	year’s	class	builds	
        on	the	previous	year’s	program	in	curriculum	experiences	and	activities	offered.	The	
        classrooms	are	set	up	to	invite	exploration	and	foster	a	lifelong	love	of	learning.	Our	staff	is	
        deeply	committed	to	the	young	child	and	the	importance	of	early	childhood	education.	
        Two’s/Young	Three’s:	 Children	must	turn	3 by	February	1	of	that	school	year.	The	focus	of	
        this	class	is	on	social	development	and	learning	through	play.	Separating	from	parents,	
        learning	to	take	direction,	and	being	nurtured	by	people	outside	of	immediate	family	are	
        important	milestones	for this	age.	The	building	of	trust	and	growing	peer	awareness	are	
        enhanced	by	a	safe	environment	that	provides	a	foundation	for	learning.		
        Three’s/Young	Four’s:	The	emphasis	in	this class	is	to	encourage	further	socialization	by	
        reinforcing	how	a	child’s	choices	affect	their	relationships	and	environment.	There	are	
        greater	expectations	for	participation	and	appropriate	play	practices.	This	class	fosters	
        independence,	creativity,	cognitive	growth,	and	motor	coordination.	Children	are	introduced	
        to	phonemic	awareness,	patterning,	number	sequencing	with	value	recognition	and	
        following	both	verbal	and	visual	directions.	
        Four’s/Young	Five’s:	The	intent	of	this	class	is	to	further	support	the	development	of	social	
        awareness,	emotional	intelligence,	and	Kindergarten	readiness	skills.	Critical	thinking,	
        science,	sequencing,	sorting	and	classification,	matching,	number	values,	phonemic	
        awareness,	problem	solving,	storytelling	and	following	multi-step	directions	are	all	
        incorporated	in	our	curriculum.	Children	develop	their	gross	and	fine	motor	skills	while	
        working	in	large	and	small	groups.	Through	play	and	collaborative	group	work,	children
        come	to	appreciate	the	value	of	cooperation	and	contribution.	The	children	are	encouraged	
        to	take	risks,	helping	them	discover	how	the	process	of	learning	is	often	more	valuable	than	
        the	outcome.	Mastering	appropriate	academic	skills	and	fostering	social	emotional	growth	
        are	the	cornerstones	of	this	program.

        Bear	Tracks
        The	Bear	Tracks	program	provides	an	extension	of	classroom	activities	for	children	who	are	
        enrolled	in	the	half-day	program. Children	who	attend	Bear	Tracks	are	ready	for	more	than	
        half-day	classes	but	perhaps	not	full-day	schedules.
        Bear	Tracks is	offered	Tuesday	through	Friday,	9:45	a.m.	– 12:30	p.m.,	for	afternoon	students
        and	Monday	through	Friday,	11:45	a.m.	– 2:30	p.m.,	for	morning	students.	Parents	may	enroll	
        their	children	for	participation	in	Bear	Tracks	for	any	or	all	days	it	is	offered.
        In	addition	to	free	choice,	outdoor	time	and	a	snack,	the	daily	Bear	Tracks	schedule	includes	
        a	special	activity.	These	activities	are	designed	to	engage	a	smaller,	multi-age	group	of	
        children	in	hands-on	learning	in	a	specialized content	area,	such	as	art,	science,	movement	or	
        literacy.	Bear	Trackers,	for	example,	might	take	a	nature hike	one	day,	create	an	art	project	
        the	next, or	dramatize	a	story in	any	particular week.
        The	main	goal	for	the	Bear	Tracks	program	is	to	continue	the	progress	children	are	making	
        in	their	regular	classroom	within	a	varied	and	creative	curriculum.	Children	must	be	toilettrained	to	enroll	in	Bear	Tracks.
