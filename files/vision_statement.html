        <h1>Vision Statement</h1>
    <p>
        Washington	University	Nursery	School:
        <ul>
            <li>Values	children	for	their	wonder	and	curiosity,	their	ideas	and	creativity,	and	their	
                delight	in	play.</li>
                <li>
                    Values	families	for	their	traditions	and	goals,	their	commitment	to	home,	work,	play,	
community,	and	their	dreams	for	their	children.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Values	teachers	for	their	vision,	their	job	in	children’s	play	and	achievements,	their	
flexibility	and	skill,	and	their	commitment	and	compassion.		We	support	and	respect	
what	we	learn	from	each	other.
                </li>
        </ul>
        Parent School Partnership
        <p>
            When	joined	by	a	common	set	of	beliefs	and	purposes,	a	school	and	its	parents	form	a	
powerful	team	with	far-reaching positive	effects	on	children	and	the	entire	school	
community.	As	a	result,	WUNS	relies	on	its	parents	to	understand	and	embrace	the	School’s	
philosophy	and	values,	and	fully	support	its	curriculum,	teachers/staff,	and	administration.	
Working	together,	parents	and	school	professionals	exert	a	strong	influence	on	children’s	
development	and	help	them	to	mature	by	modeling	healthy	adult	working	relationships	
based	on	honesty,	trust,	civility,	and	mutual	respect.	The	teachers,	staff,	and	administration	
of	WUNS	share	our	parents’	commitment	to	their	children	and	join	them	in	partnership	
dedicated	to	the	growth	of	each	child.	This	partnership	begins	with	timely,	honest	and	open	
communication	between	home	and	school,	and	is	premised	on	an	assumption	of	goodwill	
and a	shared	interest	in	what	is	best	for	each	individual	child.	Parents	can	best	support	this	
climate	of	trust	and	respect	by	communicating	concerns	openly	and	constructively	to	the	
teacher.	If	a	satisfactory	conclusion	is	not	reached,	the	parent	should	then contact	the	
Director.	Out	of	respect	for	the	individual	needs	and	privacy	of	each	family,	the	Nursery	
School places	a	high	value	on	confidentiality	and	expects	individual	families	to	honor	the	
same.	Efforts	to	lobby	other	parents	are	contrary	to	the	spirit	of	the	Parent	School	
Partnership.	By	enrolling	their	child(ren)	in	WUNS,	parents	agree	to	support	the	School’s	
vision,	follow	its	rules	and	policies,	and	abide	by	its	decisions.	Just	as	parents	can	expect	the	
Nursery	School to	share	timely	information	and	concerns	with	families	concerning	their
child,	so	too	the	Nursery	School	expects	parents	to	approach	issues	and	concerns	in	a	spirit	
of	mutual	goodwill,	using	proper	channels,	and	in	a	manner	that	gives	everyone	the	benefit	of	
the	doubt	and	leads	to	collaborative	and	constructive	solutions.	While	parents	may	not	agree	
with	every	decision,	in	most	cases,	the	parents	and	Nursery	School	will	find	enough	common	
ground	to	continue	a	mutually	respectful	and	productive	relationship.	However,	when	it	is	
clear	that	a	constructive,	positive	relationship	cannot	be	maintained,	the	School	reserves	the	
right	to	deny	continued	attendance	or	re-enrollment.
